## Business Problem

The management of Model Fitness gym would like to understand the churn behavior of the gym's members. Churn rate, which represents the percentage of members who cease their gym membership over a specific period, is a critical metric to monitor. A high churn rate can result in financial losses, decreased membership numbers, and a negative impact on the gym's reputation. 

## Objective

Predict which member is going to churn.
