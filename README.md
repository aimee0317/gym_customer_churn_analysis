# Gym Customer Churn Analysis
### Overview 
The project is to analyze a dataset with 4000 lines of customer churn data from a fictional gym called Model Fitness. Using PowerBI, an interactive dashboard is developed to pinpoint trends, patterns, and factors influencing customer attrition. The end goal is to extract insights to for the gym management to make informed deicions and implement strategies to mitigate churn and enhance customer rentention. 

### Data Overview 
The data is collected from Kaggle.com and can be access [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellanihill/model-fitness-customer-churn), It contains 13 features: gender, whether the customer lives near the gym location, partner, whether promotes the gym to friends, whether provides a phone number, contract period, whether does group visits, age, average additional charges, month to end contract, lifetime, average class frequency, average class frequency of current month.
